<p><span id="more-728"></span></p>
<hr />
<p>I did light out for that Territory and I had me a time. Jim left to find work and buy up his wife and kids, and I lived with Widow Douglas for what seemed like the whole winter through to spring before I’d had enough of schooling and stiff clothes and bibles and such. Soon as it was warm enough, I got Judge Thatcher to give me enough of my treasure money to get across the river on a ferry. I had to slip away in the early morning, and so’s not to worry the Widow and Miss Watson I left them a real long fancy note as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Ladies, I thank you kindly for all the sivilizing you’ve done me, feeding and schooling and whatnot. You are mighty good women and I’m sure you’ll go to that Good Place yet, but not too soon, since I don’t wish either you to die before you are ready. I must light out for the Territory beyond the Missasippi to seek my fortune amongst the unspoilt country of our great land, god bless America, and so on and so forth. Do not cry for my lost youth etsetra. I will come back and visit I promise. Your humble boy Huck Finn.</p>
<p>On the boat I met an old man and he talked to me about the river like old folks do. I think if people would listen to old folks more often, they would prolly have less to say.</p>
<p>He tells me, “This virgin river divides a child America from an adult America.”</p>
<p>I asked him what virgin was, and he says it’s a girl who ain’t married. I wondered what that had to do with a river, but old folks get notions that nobody but their like can explain.</p>
<p>“Just girls?” I ask him, and he says yes, that there’s something that changes in a girl when she’s married that doesn’t change for a boy. I don’t know what he meant, but I reckon it has to do with babies. I heard Miss Watson and Widow Douglas talking one time about a girl in town, talking real low and quiet-like about this girl who was going to have a baby, and hoping Jesus would take it to the Good Place, and not two days later that girl got married. I done a lot of growing up on this river, and I guess if the river is a girl then maybe she’s my Ma, tho my mama had me and some other babies that died so maybe the river isn’t a virgin after all.</p>
<p>I don’t remember Ma too well, but I remember her singing songs to me that made me feel like everything was alright and nothing could hurt me, and that’s how the river always makes me feel. I nearly died more times’n I can count on this river, but I always make it out alive. Maybe Ma’s ghost lives in there, keeping me safe and watching me grow up. Maybe she drowned in right here in the Missasippi like I nearly done time and again. Pap never let me talk much about my Ma to other people, since she was half injun and all, why I’m so much browner than Tom and Joe and near everybody.</p>
<p>So, nothin&#8217; to lose, I rode that boat across, and I didn’t feel no different on the other side ‘cept for thinking to myself, this is it Huck, you’re on your own. When I was hungry, I fished or ate berries and such. I was used to sleeping in hog sheds and the like, so finding a comfortable place to sleep warn’t too difficult. I met all kinds of people, fur trappers and injuns, but I didn’t stay long in one place. I never been much good with time, but I reckon I was by myself near six months, since it got hot and started to get cool again. Then I started to worry. I didn’t know how far north or south or west I was, hadn&#8217;t really cared enough to ask nobody, and I didn’t know if it would get real bitter cold or not.</p>
<p>Just my luck, I found a village, and I was afeared at first that they’d kill me, but then I thought maybe if I told them my mother was half injun they’d take me in. I walked into that village with my hands up, waving my white shirt in surrender, tho it warn’t too white no more, and they captured me real quick. Come to find out some of them spoke English from trading with trappers, tho more of them spoke French. I told them that my Ma was like them, and they couldn’t kill just half or a quarter of me, and then I gave them my pipe and some tobacco and they took me in.</p>
<p>I seen some mighty things in that village, all kinds of magic and whatnot. I seen a ghost get pulled right out a man&#8217;s belly by another man who dressed like a woman. He wore woman&#8217;s clothes every day, and not cause he was playing a trick. They called him Two Spirits and didn&#8217;t think a thing about it. I lived with them five winters, got to speak their language, even had me a blood brother like Tom was, but that’s a story for another day. This is a story about what happens on the river.</p>
<p>Nice as they was to me, and much as I loved my blood brother, I got powerful homesick and had to light out for home again. Next time they made their way to the river to trade, they took me with them. I worked extra hard to get enough fur and whatnot to trade for enough money to get back to the other side of the river.</p>
<p>Sure as you’re born, it didn’t take but a day to get back to town. I strutted into town with my injun clothes on, and folks just about dropped dead. Widow Douglas was so happy to see me she near cried, tho Miss Watson didn’t trust me on account I’d been injunized, as she called it. The widow told me I’d grown into such a man, and she fetched some of them stiff clothes for me to wear, but I told her since I was a man now that if I was going to wear white man’s clothing again then it better not be too itchy and stiff. She found an old shirt and some britches that her husband used to wear, and tho they weren’t as comfortable as my tribe clothes they’d do.</p>
<p>Tell you what, soon as I got into them fancy old clothes, there was a knock at the door and who do you reckon it was but Tom Sawyer, my first and dearest blood brother, all grown up like a carrot. He was so happy to see me he clapped me on the back like I was an eraser at the school. I hadn’t even thought about an eraser in years, and I wondered if they’d make me sit and read books again. That got me to thinking how I needed to make this visit a quick one.</p>
<p>I got to telling Tom all about the tribe, and my blood brother, and the fur trapping. So long had gone by. Tom was all of seventeen, and I—well, I never been sure how old I am. Taller&#8217;n Tom, that&#8217;s sure. He asked me a hundred and one questions, until it was so late that the Widow told Tom he’d have to go home. The next day being Saturday, and Tom not having anything to do, we agreed to go down to Jackson’s Island to go fishing.</p>
<p>Soon as we got down there, all by ourselves, I took off them clothes, but I folded them up real nice since they must’a been special to the Widow, having belonged to her dead husband and all. I learned a lot of respect in my time with that tribe. Tom stripped off too, and we ran right into the water and splashed around a long time.</p>
<p>“You sure are an injun now Huck,” he says, “you smell just awful like one!” He grabbed me and tried to rub water on my underarms, but I wiggled away. I ducked him under, but I knew he was just picking at me. Jealous, prolly, that I get to be a real injun and he can only play pretend. I bet if he could he’d smell like this too.</p>
<p>I spent that whole summer camping on Jackson’s Island. Seemed like I spent more time there than at the Widow’s house, which I guess suited her and her sister just as well. Tom came down less often, him having to do work to keep up his aunt’s place. He become real close with Joe Harper, and brought Joe with him sometimes, though other times he said Joe couldn’t make it. He was lying at least once I knew because when they got down to the island Joe was real quiet and I could tell he was sore about something. He mentioned later that Tom should’a told him last time he was coming down, that he had spent all day inside from the rain. It kinda made me feel good, knowing that Tom would rather see me and just me sometimes. I guess I know how Joe felt too cause sometimes Tom would go off with Joe and not invite me along. I got to wonderin&#8217; why I wasn’t invited, but I figgered it was one&#8217;a Tom&#8217;s little games, makin&#8217; me and Joe Harper jealous of the other like that.</p>
<p>One day, Tom was down on the island with me, and we were being real lazy and lying around in the shade. Out of nowheres, Tom says, “Do you miss Jim?” and I reckon I did and missed him something mighty sore. I told him as much, and I got to thinking about old Jim and me on Jackson’s Island, on the raft. Jim would always call me Honey and I reckon that’s what black folk say when they care about somebody. Not many people ever cared about me more’n a hill of beans.</p>
<p>I remember lying on that raft in the sunshine, not a care in the world, us both just naked as the day we were born. All these stiff clothes that Tom’s ‘spected to wear, well I don’t reckon I know how he can stand it sometimes. Ain’t natural, iff’n you ask me, and I told him as much.</p>
<p>Tom says to me, “What was that like, being naked with a full grown man?” I told him it warn’t nothing to it. Hot out, you’re on a raft, you don’t wear no clothes. ‘Sides, I told Tom we been runnin’ around the island naked since we was little, and now we’re grown and we’re still naked, what’s the difference? He kinda turned away from me then, bashful I reckon, not wanting me to see his boy parts. But Tom’s funny like that, ‘specially since I come back years later and we both got hair under our arms and on our boy parts and whatnot, sometimes he’s okay me seeing him and sometimes not. I was sitting there wondering to myself, don’t Tom know me better’n that? Then Tom says to me the oddest thing I ever heard him say, and believe me he says some odd things.</p>
<p>He says, “Anything pick-yoo-lee-er happen when you two was naked on the raft?” Says it just like that, pick-yoo-lee-er.</p>
<p>“Like what, Tom?” I says, starting to get fed up, “Confound you, you’re talkin’ all around something in that head a’ yours. What kinda notion you got?” He was worrying the ground with some stick he had. Then out’a nowheres, he says, “Didn’t you never, you know&#8230; try touching Jim?”</p>
<p>That was about all I could take’a his questions. All his book learning, and he’s asking me about things I barely even thought about, ‘specting me to have done this and that and played some kinda naked touching game with my friend. I picked up a half a handful of sand and threw it at him.</p>
<p>Well, Tom and I got into a big fuss, he punched me in the shoulder and I knocked him one, but Tom’s always been a dirty fighter and knocks my legs out from under me. I’m not down that easy, and I grabbed him and we tumped over the tree roots. This point, Tom was on top’a me, and started laughing and looking at me funny. My back hurt on the ground and Tom’s weight was pushing me into the roots, but I didn’t move.</p>
<p>“Say you’re sorry, Tom,” I says to him.</p>
<p>“For what?” he says, holding me down by the shoulders. He had his knees on my legs in a way that kept me from getting a good foot to lift up.</p>
<p>“For asking me if I was touching Jim! What does that even mean? It can’t be nothing good, knowing you and your mind!” I says. I was thinking about spitting in his eye, but maybe that wouldn’t a’ been fair. Even if Tom fights dirty, I learned well and good to fight fair.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get afraid that Tom’ll go too far, and then I’ll go too far, and Tom’ll get sore about it and stop being my friend. Pain in the britches that Tom is, I’d go to Hell or even church for him. ‘Sides, I guess I deserved being down there with my back against them rough roots for throwing the sand at him.</p>
<p>“You say it, Huck,” Tom says. I tried to raise up but Tom had me. “Say sorry.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Tom, now get off&#8217;a me!” He did, that rat, and as he flipped over I saw his boy parts had gotten big. He kinda shut his legs together and turned his body so I couldn’t see, but I seen it already. That got me to thinking about what he’d said.</p>
<p>A lot of moments went by and we didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;. He was breathin&#8217; hard, lookin&#8217; all around but not at me. Then I asked him what he meant by touching. He says I know just what he means. Like you touch yourself sometimes. I says to Tom, “I ain’t never touched Jim like that.”</p>
<p>“Funny,” Tom says, and starts laughing his little fake laugh when I can tell he’s got something cooking in his brain like a fever. Not like how he was laughing when he had me on the ground. The kinda laugh that the Widow Douglas would call, &#8220;downright sinister.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What’s so funny,” I ask him, but he keeps right on with his little snickering. He was still sitting with his body turned away from me. After a moment he says to me, “So you wouldn’t touch Jim like that, huh?” and he took a long time to say Jim&#8217;s name, like when he said pick-yoooo-lier.</p>
<p>“Damn right I wouldn’t. I’d feel mighty rotten touchin’ Jim like that. That’s for a man to do by hisself.” Then Tom says something that changes things, and I mean changes them forever. Made me feel like I’d just spent a year on that river, learned so much in a moment.</p>
<p>“It ain’t for a man to do alone, neither.”</p>
<p>I could feel my heart beating hard, and not because I’d just wrestled Tom. I’d been touching myself time to time, most days seemed like, but never with anyone around. Just didn&#8217;t seem proper to do somethin&#8217; with my privates in front&#8217;a someone else. I knowed Tom did it too, we talked about it once, but I ain’t never heard tell of men or boys doing that together.</p>
<p>Not hearing back from me, Tom kept right on talking. “I done it with another boy before.” Then I couldn’t help wondering out loud. “Who, Tom?”</p>
<p>“Nobody,” he says. He moved, sitting with his back to one tree, across from me, my back to the other tree. I remember hearing the morning dove calling then. To me it always sounded like, “Who cooks for who?”</p>
<p>Tom looked at me with one eye, and tho his face was turned to the side I could tell he was smiling with only half his mouth.</p>
<p>“I bet it was Ben Rogers,” I says, “fool that he is. He’d let you sell him a wooden nickel.”<br />
“Wasn’t neither,” he says.</p>
<p>“Then it has to be Joe Harper. Did you touch Joe’s parts, Tom?” I was curious, and kinda worried, and a little of something else all at once.</p>
<p>“Never you mind, Huck. Ain’t your concern.”</p>
<p>“Why’d you bring it up, then? Secrets are for girls, Tom!”</p>
<p>Tom looked full at me then. I didn’t know what to do. I could feel my blood all hot in my face, and then I started to feel it hot all over.</p>
<p>“You wanna watch me, Huck? We could both do it. Ain’t no shame to it.” I didn’t say nothing, just looked down at my body and my own parts.</p>
<p>“This is our place, Huck. Nobody’s gonna see. Ain’t no steamboat floating loaves of bread full of quicksilver and people after it.” He made me laugh then. He came over and sat next to me. There I was on Jackson&#8217;s Island, in the place that I could get away from everyone, even Tom most times, and I was sitting with my back on a tree, the big bumpy old roots under my legs kinda hurting me, but in a good way, you know, like when you get whupped for something and you know you deserve it, and there was Tom, looking at me. I was still wondering who else he’d done this with. Sure as you’re born, I bet it was Joe Harper.</p>
<p>Tom brushed the sand off his hands real well, and I did it too, so’s not to get them little bits on my tenderest parts. Tom started in on himself, I started in on myself, and it felt good, good as it ever did, but new, too. Tough to put it in words, it was just like doing it regular, but like doing it in a dream, where it’s familiar but also not, all at once. I guess mostly I was just surprised at myself doing this with Tom, but I didn’t want him to get mad at me or feel all embarrassed about bringing it up. It didn’t really feel too strange once we’d started, tho I was still feeling nervous.</p>
<p>Then Tom says, “You’re doing it wrong.”</p>
<p>I says to him, “I always do it like this.”</p>
<p>Tom says, “No, watch me,” and he kinda rubs himself with his whole hand instead of the way I do it using the skin at the end. Then he turns his hand upside down and does the same thing backward. I tried to do it like that, but it was just strange and I wanted to do it my way, so I did.</p>
<p>He says, “Stop, Huck, do it the right way.”</p>
<p>I says, “I like my way,” and I almost threw more sand on him but thought that he would wrestle me again, and that might be just what he wanted.</p>
<p>“You don’t know anything, Huck. You’ll break it like that, the way you’re doin it. It’ll make your hands hairy if you do that.”</p>
<p>“I ain’t broke it yet, and I got as much hair on the back of my hands as you do.”</p>
<p>“Look, there’s a right way and a wrong way.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? Who showed you the right way? Joe? Or did you read it in one a’ them fancy books? The Big Book Of How To Touch Your Boy Parts? I knowed you ain’t read about this in no bible.”</p>
<p>I stopped then. Tom stopped too, and he says, “Why you keep bringin’ up Joe for? You jealous or somethin’?”</p>
<p>I got real huffy then and stood up. Tom was still sitting against the tree but I could see that look in his eye like he was up to something. “Nothin&#8217; to be jealous about, Tom! You think jest cause you been doin’ this with another boy and not me that I’m jealous? I was doin’ this fine on my own till you decided to show me your damn fool &#8216;right way&#8217;!”</p>
<p>Tom stood up then, and caught me by the arm and tried to get me to sit down again, but I warn’t ready to do that. I was mad at him, and he was gonna hear about it. I told him to quit, but he wouldn’t let go, so I went for his legs like he did with mine before, and I knocked him down but he took me with him, that rat, and we tumbled in the grass until he was on top of me again. For some reason, all I could think was how we used to do this all the time when we were kids, and it was just different now, wouldn’t be like that ever again, not ever.</p>
<p>He was looking right into me, like my face was a few inches back from its rightful place, like he was looking into eyes that were inside my head &#8216;stead of out. Then I starts thinking the strangest thing yet, pick-yoo-lee-er alright. I starts to feel like I belonged there, under him I mean. It felt good. I know it sounds crazy, but it felt good having Tom pin me down like that, his knees on my legs and his hands holding my wrists against the sand and grass. Who feels good being held down like that? Maybe Joe Harper.</p>
<p>“There’s a right way and a wrong way, Huck. Now you gotta tell me to stop but not stop me.” Confound that Tom Sawyer.</p>
<p>“What am I supposed to say?”</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to beg me not to do nothing to you, but then you don’t stop me, neither. That’s the way of it.”</p>
<p>I looked up at him and his body was so pink, not like mine. “If I don’t want you to stop, why I got to tell you to?”</p>
<p>“It’s just the way it’s done, Huck. Pirates do this to each other all the time. I read about it in one of Judge Thatcher’s law books. That’s when there ain’t no women around. Then, when they sack a village and they kidnap the women, they do this to them. The pirates do it to each other while they’re out at sea, but some of them act like the women so the others can practice.”</p>
<p>“But women ain’t got no boy parts, Tom.”</p>
<p>Tom’s eyes got really wide then, and he starts laughing fit to raise the dead and drops on top a’ me. I let him be there. It felt good, his body pressing mine into the grass like that, his skin against mine. I raised my hands above my head and I told him okay, he could pin me again.</p>
<p>He did, and he brushed his free hand off real slow on my side, and it kinda tickled but not in a bad way. I told him to cut it out, that it warn’t right what he was doing to me, that I’d tell the authorities, and other stuff I’d heard that sounded like what you say when someone’s got you pinned down touchin&#8217; you nasty and won’t let you up. Damn foolish, if you ask me, but that’s what Tom wanted and I guess I didn’t really want him to let up on me just yet.</p>
<p>“See Huck, when you touch yourself, you gotta do it like this,” and then he starts in on me. I reckon it did feel better than what I do, but I think it was probably just that he was doing it and not me, like how you can’t really tickle your own self. There was so much going on, his left hand pushing my wrists into the grass, his right hand working on me, his knees kinda hurting the thickest parts of my legs, his toes wiggling against my knees. It’s like I got lost in my own body.</p>
<p>He did that until the special thing happened that always happens if you do it long enough. We went into the water and got cleaned up then, and when we got back to the trees he wanted me to do the same thing to him, but not pin him down. He said he was the captain and I was the mate, and the mate doesn’t push the captain down. Sometimes he sounds like he’s making sense but then I think on what he tells me, and it don’t really. It don’t bother me much I reckon, long as we get where we mean to go. So he sat down against the tree and I sat in front of him and tried to do what he’d done on me, and he got to the end part a lot quicker than I had. It got on me, and I ran into the water quick like a rabbit.</p>
<p>Seems like each time we went back there to Jackson’s Island that summer, he had something new he wanted to show me. Most of it was nice, but some things took all day to convince me to do. Usually he’d get me to agree to let him do something to me, and then when I knew it warn’t nothing to be scared of, I’d do it to him too. Some days he just wanted me to do everything and him not do anything back. When I’d flat out refuse, cause that ain’t fair, he’d wrestle me down and pin me again and I’d pretend I was saying no. That got him real excited, and I never did understand what that was all about. Take it or leave it, I don’t see why nobody needs to play pretend games just to touch each other.</p>
<p>One day, soon as we got to the island, I started taking off my britches, and Tom says, “No, I don’t want to do that no more.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” I says, real confused. I thought playing pirates was Tom’s favorite.</p>
<p>“Because I turned eighteen already, and that’s how old you are when you stop doing that with other boys.”</p>
<p>“What about me? I don’t even know how old I am, so that means I can do it however much I want.” I’d started liking it more and more, and wondering about doing it with other boys ‘sides Tom. Girls, too. It must be real different with a girl, and I mean to try it.</p>
<p>“Well,” says Tom, “I heard that what we been doing is supposed to be something a man does with a woman only.”</p>
<p>“Read that in a book, did you?” I asked him, meaner than I should’a been. He looked at me and he wasn’t even angry, just looking mighty sad. It hurt me to see that, so I told him I was sorry. “I thought that’s what pirates did, Tom. When women weren’t around.”</p>
<p>“I’m gettin&#8217; too old to play pirate games, Huck.”</p>
<p>That made me sad too. Tom’s always been my captain. This whole touching thing we’d been up to, it really was like being pirates, adventuring on them high seas. Like we were discovering treasure and new islands. His hands were the gold on Cuba, his mouth was rubies on Jamayka, and I always thought that special part at the end was the pearls, for obvious reasons, etsetra.</p>
<p>That day we didn’t talk much. I got him to play pirates one more time after the sun set, and did whatever he wanted me to do, even that one thing he really likes but I don’t like because it kinda hurts, but that was the last time he went to Jackson’s Island with me. I still see Tom around, but it ain’t the same. He’s gonna marry Becky Thatcher, and then she’ll have babies and she won’t be a virgin no more. I reckon I’ll go back across that river to the tribe, where I can show them everything I learned this summer. Lately, I gone back to touching alone, and it ain’t the same. It’s not even the touching I miss so much. I miss Tom. It was his idea to start it all, and it’s just foolish that he can’t look me in the eye no more. It’s just not natural to give up your blood brother like that.</p>

<p><span id="more-723"></span></p>
<p>1. Little Pine Eye</p>
<p><em>            Pinocchio, </em>1911</p>
<p>In Collodi’s original tale, the unborn log feels the burn of the scalpello, crying out. Some endure chisel and adze just to look human. We massage the grain to soften it to flesh, but the termites are already in. The nose dry-rots off of the face. Carpenter ants take off with our lips shared in their pincers. Pray, fantoccino, that some blue, asphyxiated fairy will hear your mulch of tears hitting the earth floor and pity you, grant you mortality. Pray you live long enough to die a man. How many paths to that eternal forest fire? Choking on an acorn or boiling in your own sap, soul divorced from stump, but take comfort. Recall that fire is a miracle, the gift of Prometheus who, like Film, stole light. Fire blasts your shadow into sudden cleansing drama, a flood of shine into a darkened wood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. All the Electrical Secrets of Heaven</p>
<p><em>Frankenstein</em>, 1931</p>
<p>The lab apparatus goes like a Catherine wheel, slinging its chips of light. “The body isn’t ‘dead’ if it has never truly ‘lived.’” Hogwash. Every fragment had its day. Now they rest, waiting. The doctor and his cripple rob the graves. Frankenstein throws his spade of earth in Death&#8217;s face. And the creature! A flat-headed numbskull, a droop-eyed ghoul with one sunken cheek. Laborattoir tally: the lives of a few rabbits and dogs. Daisies tossed into the lake. The trapper stumbles, mouth slack, presenting his sopping offspring. The toothless mob gathers, calling for death. No wonder at such anger; their sky is but a wrinkled backdrop; their roles but pomp and prop. Strickfaden saves nothing, resurrects everything. Raise a glass to the Hollywood ending: a son to the House of Frankenstein (A living one this time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Creature of the Night</p>
<p><em>            The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>, 1975</p>
<p>I crashed the theater tonight and popcorn flew. I thought I dreamed the picture; it melted like a tab of LSD and everybody loved me. A monster flexed like Flash Gordon in gold briefs. I tore off my disguise and leapt before their screen. I lost my virginity in the back row, my stitches out and all. My girl (I guess she was a girl) sang out to bless her soul, so I did. I sucked her earlobes and spluttered cool. By then Sarandon’s eyes were as big as my fists. She made love to the monster! The doctor died for glamour! See—?</p>
<p>You people break the laws of science for love. You slay each other with pickaxes for love. So I’ll make every one of you love me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Dyscephalus</p>
<p><em>The Elephant Man</em>, 1980</p>
<p>My head, but not <em>my</em> head. A knobby pumpkin spinning on a pole, a Harryhausen puppet. Putty, sticks, and wire. My greatest discovery: the latent medical anomaly: <em>dyscephalus</em>. I coined it myself, &#8220;the disorder of extremities in which the subject&#8217;s head, seemingly attached, is clearly not the head belonging on that body.&#8221; Lately, I’m devising means to shuck it and release this handsome, sweating face beneath. A slow melt, revealing the actor embedded in all that wax; or yank a stiff corner of gauze to unwrap the death mask; or else worms to eat away the outer onion. Medicine is messy. O head, dear head, throne of sense and senses, you hateful helmet! Why can&#8217;t I pull you off?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Rebirth Is Always Painful</p>
<p><em>Re-Animator</em>, 1985</p>
<p>Today we play the meat card. The sticky. Today innards uncoil like vines and seize you by the ankle. The best elixirs always glow   <em>ever notice?</em>   like teenage lightning. We bless the syringe and push into epidural space   <em>Flush of bioluminescence: hormone geyser: phosphorescence</em>   Howling like a newborn, dragged back from the cold and liquid Afterworld for another go at breath, a second death. Today we press some flesh. Today we peel up the toenail. Ancient question: when dead folks walk, do they know poetry? Or is it all just hunger, brains, and meat? Don&#8217;t fool yourself—a zombie does feel pain. It&#8217;s the pain itself that has ceased to hold meaning.</p>

<p><span id="more-718"></span></p>
<p>Patrick Soames encountered his ex-girlfriend as he emerged from the party house’s bathroom. Rebecca, deep in her fifth cup, spoke to Patrick with even more venom than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;So are you some kind of furry now, you queer bastard?&#8221;</p>
<p>She wore a rather pathetic get-up—a ragged black dress with an asymmetrical hem and a neckline that nearly reached her navel, one black elbow glove, bright red heels that didn&#8217;t go anywhere, and a pointed black plastic hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t furries&#8230;have fur?&#8221; Patrick refrained from commenting on her “Sexy Witch” costume, something she&#8217;d probably found on clearance that morning. She could&#8217;ve afforded spectacular tailoring on her realtor&#8217;s salary, could&#8217;ve paid someone to have the creativity and dedication she lacked. Instead, she looked like cold, wet shit with cleavage.</p>
<p>Patrick’s Halloween costume, though elaborate, was also relatively light and easy to take on and off. There was even a pocket he&#8217;d devised inside to stow his wallet, keys, and phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever. I mean what are you supposed to be, a dragon or something?&#8221; She looked him up and down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a seahorse.&#8221; He&#8217;d taken pains, perfecting it. He formed the papier maché into the ridged body and the elegant, elongated head, painted it a glossy pale green, created the fins from repurposed Spanish lace fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh. You&#8217;re so weird.&#8221; She had to grab the wall for support, and Patrick hoped to be in the room when she inevitably wiped out on those heels and bashed her face against the tile floor. He imagined a tooth snapping off from her jaw and skidding to a bloody halt at his foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your car, Becky? Did the court give you back your license?&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd at the party continued slipping in and out of the hallway, their costumes mostly uninspired. One or two paused and looked over when they heard the comment, but most stepped away quickly from the rage that simmered in Rebecca&#8217;s throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck you, Patrick!&#8221; she half-belched.</p>
<p>Even shitfaced, she knew how to eviscerate him verbally. To leave her with nothing but <em>fuck you</em> was indeed a triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you want, Patrick. You never know,&#8221; she gurgled, turning to make her way through the crowd.</p>
<p>She was wrong.</p>
<p>Patrick watched her go, then followed into the largest gathering room of the house. She pushed then pulled the sliding glass door and stumbled into the back yard. She was gorgeous, and whenever she remained sober she reminded him of the woman he once loved. The other Becky. He thought of their past together as a three-way relationship without the best part; he made love to sober Becky and to drunk Becky, but never both at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s still in love with you,&#8221; Danny said, sneaking up behind him. Danny had that horror movie quality, moving silently up to people and starting conversations from nothing but a desire to be acknowledged. &#8220;She talks about how much she misses you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you telling me that?&#8221; Patrick turned and intentionally knocked Danny across the forehead with the beak of the seahorse head atop his own.</p>
<p>Danny took a step back, his boots clopping audibly on the tile floor, above the din of the packed house. &#8220;Watch it! You&#8217;ll break my horns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danny’s stubby little satyr horns nestled into his curly brown hair. Stripped to the waist, he&#8217;d fashioned fur leggings ending in hoofish fetish boots, the kind with no heel, forcing the wearer to perch on the balls of the feet. He&#8217;d drawn on chest hair and a goatee using brown eye pencil. Danny would likely be his type, if he were more attracted to men—needy, highly intelligent, yet oblivious, painting curls of dainty hair around shaved nipples. Poor Danny. Rebecca&#8217;s pet.</p>
<p>Danny sipped his bottle of cider and avoided eye contact, yammering on. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t want you to take it personally. She only hates you because she loves you, does that make sense?”</p>
<p>Patrick didn&#8217;t need to get off with Danny; he just needed Danny to. Patrick had to cast Majesty in order to convince himself he could do the deed. He broke the entire task into a series of smaller spells: find Danny; charm Danny; get Danny across the threshold of the house; convince Danny to follow through. It was a gamble that the man would even be at the party. It had to be tonight. If it came down to it, Patrick was ready to use Poundr or one of the other apps to find a replacement offering, but using a stranger was a last resort. Danny would be easier to control.</p>
<p>He flipped the seahorse&#8217;s head back on its hinge, revealing his own sweaty blond hair. &#8220;She&#8217;s still in love with me, huh? And what about you, Danny?&#8221;</p>
<p>Danny bobbed and swayed to the sounds of &#8220;Thriller&#8221; floating in from the back yard, watching the men in the more revealing costumes as they came and went. He seemed to enjoy the one night a year when the straight men were granted permission to roam around as objects and prey.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not in love with me. She would tell me. She can&#8217;t keep anything a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick closed the snare. &#8220;But are <em>you </em>still in love with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Danny blinked but didn&#8217;t break his gaze into the middle distance. &#8220;Did she tell you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick lifted his fingertips and touched the nadir of Danny&#8217;s painted chin, turned it so they were eye to eye. With all his conjured courage, he closed the snare on Danny. &#8220;It’s pretty obvious.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>As the car made its way down the rain-spattered paving of Interstate 5, they made the small talk of those about to fuck: how nice and clean the car is, how they each still live in the same buildings in Seattle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you still Wiccan?&#8221; Patrick asked. He thought he should do something approximating affection, like ruffle Danny&#8217;s hair or stroke his ear. He decided not to push his luck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uhhhh yeah, of course I&#8217;m still Wiccan. Are you still an atheist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really. No, I suppose by definition I&#8217;m not an atheist anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car exited the highway onto the suburban street. Soon, the car pulled into its place in the garage, and the door went loudly down behind it. Step by step, Patrick drew Danny into the quaint little rambler house.</p>
<p>Patrick led him into the kitchen. &#8220;Can I get you a drink? Water? Beer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ummm yeah, a beer would be great. I guess I&#8217;m still a little nervous, y&#8217;know? I liked you for a really long time, and I&#8217;m still kinda shocked that we&#8217;re here. Where should I put these boots?&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his hand on Danny&#8217;s shoulder, as if about to say something, then pulled him in and kissed him. It felt close to kissing women, not so bad at all.</p>
<p>He pulled away. Danny looked at him with all the tender grief of someone who is given sex when they want love. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you that beer.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Danny cleaned off false whiskers of makeup and prepared himself for sex, Patrick made the final arrangements in the bedroom. He quietly summoned the Qlippothic host to accept the offering. He lit his candles and drew his sigils, then swallowed the drug he&#8217;d procured from the Thelemists who worked at the bookstore. His heart grew steadily faster.</p>
<p>When Danny at last came into the bedroom, clean and clad only in regrettable Superman briefs, Patrick took a moment to admire him. <em>This is going to work</em>, he assured himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Danny asked. &#8220;You&#8217;re staring at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. Sorry.” Patrick sat on the edge of the bed. The bedside lamp glowed and the candles flickered.</p>
<p>Danny walked towards him. &#8220;The candles are a nice touch. Wasn&#8217;t expecting that.&#8221; He stopped in front of him, their knees touching, Danny looking down into Patrick&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I wanted to make it nice for you. Is it nice?&#8221; Patrick&#8217;s anxiety grew as Danny&#8217;s subsided.</p>
<p>Danny kissed him on the forehead. &#8220;It&#8217;s very nice. You&#8217;re very nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick tilted his face up and kissed him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still can&#8217;t believe this is happening,&#8221; Danny said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Halloween. We all get to be something different, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Danny smiled down at him and kissed him again. &#8220;Good point.&#8221;</p>
<p>He climbed onto the bed. &#8220;Ummm do you get tested for STDs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Me too. I&#8217;m all clear. You?&#8221; Danny started running his hands underneath Patrick&#8217;s shirt. Patrick&#8217;s stomach quivered as Danny&#8217;s fingertips brushed along it. It felt better than he&#8217;d expected it to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Patrick rubbed Danny&#8217;s thigh. If he was going to do this, he might as well enjoy it for what it was. For all he knew, he might enjoy this enough to do it again.</p>
<p>He kept his hands on Danny&#8217;s face, which he guided down to his neck, across his chest, and down, as Danny kissed and nibbled him.</p>
<p>The blowjob almost made him cum, and he withdrew from Danny’s mouth.</p>
<p>Danny smiled up at him. &#8220;You gonna unload inside me, stud?&#8221; He sounded just like the men with whom Patrick had been practicing the conversation on Poundr. All the unnecessary small talk.</p>
<p>Patrick&#8217;s heart clenched. If he thought too much about what to say, he would ruin it, and they were almost there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, Danny, I was hoping you&#8217;d unload inside me first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danny snickered at him. Why did he laugh? &#8220;You are full of surprises tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick used the line he&#8217;d been rehearsing in the mirror all week. &#8220;I just thought, if I&#8217;m going to be with a man, I might as well try it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danny giggled and said, &#8220;I can fuck you. If that&#8217;s what you want. Maybe we could switch after?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Promise,&#8221; Patrick lied. He reached up and ran his fingers through Danny&#8217;s curly brown hair. He sat up, kissed Danny hard, then turned around and got onto his hands and knees. &#8220;Like this. Till you cum inside me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to use a condom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up and do it, Danny!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long and anxious moment, nothing happened. Patrick was sure he&#8217;d ruined it. He even heard the faintest laughter in the air, but not from the man just behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Sir,&#8221; Danny finally said, and Patrick heard the sound of the top of the lube bottle click open.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Afterward, Patrick thought he could feel the demons moving inside him. He hoped the offering would please them enough.</p>
<p>Danny cuddled him. &#8220;So? Was it everything you imagined?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; Patrick replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick didn&#8217;t speak again. He soon heard Danny snoring, giving Patrick the opportunity to close the ritual without fucking Danny. That was good. Less to go wrong.</p>
<p>In the morning, he allowed Danny to kiss him, then shooed him out with a breakfast bar and cab fare. He watched Danny&#8217;s face in the cab window, the same expression he&#8217;d seen the night before, that bittersweet wish. Danny waved. Patrick didn&#8217;t wave back.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>At first, there was nothing. Two weeks and no recognizable effect.</p>
<p>Then nausea, which never fully subsided. Patrick became hopeful. Soon, a diarrhea, which lasted two months. He feared taking pills for it, lest the chemicals interfere. Patrick worried that his body would reject the work entirely, send it spraying out of him like spoiled shellfish.</p>
<p>He lost weight so quickly that his coworkers chittered about cancer or AIDS. He overheard as they dared each other to ask him. None did. Only his team manager, Katie, broached the subject.</p>
<p>As she sat behind her desk in her creamy cotton/poly blend pantsuit, Katie&#8217;s soft brown hands twisted a large diamond engagement ring around her finger. &#8220;Patrick, are you&#8230;okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced away from her hands to her bookcase: an abyss of manuals presented to impress visitors. Coding texts, management guides, some soft-New-Age drivel about &#8220;sacred agreements,&#8221; and one book with its cover facing outward rather than its spine: <em>Working with Difficult People</em>.</p>
<p>The abyss of books stared back at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patrick. I asked you if you&#8217;re okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked back at her and tried to make eye contact, his eyes dull and sunken.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine, Katie. Thank you for asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>She slipped off her ring and pumped a few squirts into her palm from an obscenely large container of hand sanitizer. &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t look fine. You look like you haven&#8217;t slept in a week. Do you need to take some sick days?&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick huffed. &#8220;Maybe I do. I&#8217;ll let you know.&#8221; He looked back down again. He wondered if she sanitized her hands during every meeting, or if that was a quirk she reserved especially for him. Perhaps she truly hated him. Perhaps was just neurotic. He suspected both to be the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Patrick, you seem pretty broken down. Have you been staying up working on a new project?&#8221; She wiped the sanitizer down past her wrists, then put the ring back on.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Sort of. Not really. I just haven&#8217;t been feeling well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you&#8230;taking anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not on drugs, Katie. I&#8217;m not even taking drugs for the nausea.&#8221; Without any physical sensation to warn him, tears suddenly came down his cheeks. He panicked and began to sob.</p>
<p>Katie grabbed a box of tissues from her workstation. &#8220;Jesus, Patrick! That&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re going home early. Jenny will take over your part of the app.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he snapped, and Katie jerked backward. &#8220;That&#8217;s my project! Do not give it to Jenny. I&#8217;ll finish it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katie clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth. &#8220;Sounds like you&#8217;re under a lot of stress right now. Tell you what—take tomorrow off too. Come back Monday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick felt his panic rising. Would she fire him? He&#8217;d never snapped at a boss before.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Patrick? Go. See. A doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thanked her and left her office. He heard her pumping out more sanitizer as the door closed behind him.</p>
<p>He took the days off, but didn&#8217;t see the doctor. No good could come of that. Instead he researched conditions that would present the same physical changes he endured. He picked hyperthyroidism and reported back to Katie on Monday. There would have to be more tests; he might have to try several treatments over the next few months before his endocrine system evened out. Katie bought the whole ruse, but she&#8217;d also given the project to Jenny.</p>
<p>By the middle of January, he was ravenous. Drawn gaunt from the intestinal changes, he began eating almost hourly, the weight quickly gathering around him, such a sudden opposite extreme that his coworkers began to avoid him altogether. <em>People can tell I&#8217;m off</em>. The thought nagged at him.</p>
<p>More likely it was the smell. Bottomless in his hungers, the stuffs he craved were often not considered food at all, and he could tell when their scents lingered on him, not so much a wet and cloying rot as a musty decay. Through February, he couldn&#8217;t get enough mushrooms. Raw, with farmer&#8217;s dirt still clinging to them, he clapped handfuls into his mouth or nibbled the larger discs like pita bread. By the Ides of March, he foraged lichens off rocks and trees.</p>
<p>He let the bread molder in earnest—cheese as well—then pressed black and green sandwiches on the skillet, toasting five or six at a go for supper. His gut churned, but every spasm refined and repurposed his body. No going back—this was part of him, in him and of him at the same time.</p>
<p>He received his mother&#8217;s monthly call in April. He asked her how she was doing, half-listened to her answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know. I have my good days and my bad days.&#8221; She began to go through a month&#8217;s worth of inconsequential small talk. Another cousin engaged. His aunt travelled in Asia. The arthritis pained her more this week. His sister had had yet another miscarriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christ, why don&#8217;t they just adopt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, shame on you, Patrick. Be considerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The power circulating in his body emboldened him. &#8220;No, shame on them. Shame on Elissa and Tom. They keep putting themselves through this. It&#8217;s senseless and bizarre. They&#8217;re so desperate for—I don&#8217;t even know what.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when do you care this much? When&#8217;s the last time you called your sister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call her this weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>His mother made a quick goodbye and hung up. Good. Patrick had never known what to say to her, even in adolescence. She talked mostly of things uninteresting or else unfortunate.</p>
<p>Elissa called him an hour later.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say to Mom? She called me, and she was totally ape shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she now? I didn&#8217;t even say anything about her. I think she&#8217;s living vicariously through you. She really wants that grandbaby.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pause, then, &#8220;Patrick, who the hell are you? We haven&#8217;t talked in months, and suddenly you&#8217;re Mister Bold and Cruel?&#8221;</p>
<p>He said nothing. The boldness was another unexpected emotional effect; he made a mental note. Elissa went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just meant—you&#8217;re just so unemotional all the time. And now Mom calls and tells me you&#8217;re cursing at her over the phone. What is going on? Are you in some weird therapy? Landmark Forum or something like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled so widely his dry lips cracked. &#8220;Something like that. And I didn&#8217;t curse at her, I think I only said &#8216;Christ.&#8217; In vain, but still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know Mom. She still isn&#8217;t over the fact that you&#8217;re an atheist. Mom wonders if you&#8217;re gay or something. She wishes you stayed with Rebecca. She really liked Rebecca. She was the only woman you ever brought home. And she was Catholic.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was too much. &#8220;Rebecca is an alcoholic bitch who nearly killed me. Does Mom remember that little detail? That Becky almost actually killed me with her car?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elissa hesitated, then said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it was like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yeah, it was like that. And maybe I <em>am</em> gay, Elissa. Or something else. Something worse than gay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patrick, stop it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m truly sorry that you keep miscarrying. If anyone deserves a baby, it&#8217;s you. Of everyone in our family, you&#8217;re the only one who doesn&#8217;t make me feel like an outsider in our own mother’s house.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t even realized he was crying until it broke up his voice. He seemed to cry all the time now, even when he felt exhilarated and unstoppable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patrick, I know we haven&#8217;t been close in a while, but you&#8217;re my baby brother. I still think of you as this amazing little kid, pretending to be a wizard in the back yard. I just want you to be happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you too,&#8221; he said, not sure whether he&#8217;d heard her say it. “I think I need to go. Thanks for calling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Please figure out how to be happy, Patrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to be, Elissa. I think I&#8217;m finally going to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>He could only imagine what went on inside his body. Externally, there was the weight gain, much of it a watery swelling more so than mere fat. He still found himself racked by sentimentality, which he should&#8217;ve foreseen but hadn&#8217;t expected. He fancied himself a logical man, not a passionate one. He&#8217;d expected the capricious mood swings to be only temporary, but as April poured itself into May, Patrick wondered if the sentimentality might be permanent. After all, the spell inside of him would soon make its way out, and then what would he do?</p>
<p>Crowley fantasized about it but never pulled it off. Anaxagoras attributed it to gods alone, while some Inuit groups preserved legends about special men able to do it. It was through intensive occult study that Patrick had figured it out in the first place. God and magic had been nothing to him but equal rubbish, but fascinating rubbish.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until he tried a few spells—just for the hell of it—that belief quickly swallowed him up. The Abundance ritual had yielded a lottery ticket with five out of six numbers, netting a thousand dollar payout. Finding buffalo teeth and wolf piss proved far more difficult than actually getting the money, but the internet was a deep and filthy place.</p>
<p><em>I’ll be more specific next time</em>, and he was. He asked for nine thousand and thirteen dollars, just to see how precise he could get. A great aunt died and left him eleven thousand. After some inheritance tax fondling by his accountant, exactly nine thousand and thirteen dollars remained—after the accountant’s fee.</p>
<p>Awkward Patrick, suddenly pulling the wires, programming reality. He inverted the legend of the secular archaeologist who sought to debunk Genesis but instead became born again. While Christ dangled on the sunlit side of the Tree of Life, Patrick meditated in the Tree&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p>All this sudden power, and he only really wanted one thing, the same thing he’d wanted since before Rebecca. Fame, money, sex—these fleeting things existed for smaller minds.</p>
<p>No. Given a knowledge of this hidden clockwork and a schedule of demonic fees, Patrick chose grand ambition over pedestrian cantrips. Even if he failed, he’d already taken the spell much further than anyone he&#8217;d read about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m putting in my two weeks&#8217; notice,&#8221; he told Katie. He beamed, radiant and predatory, an ecstatic jackal.</p>
<p>She sneezed into her elbow and grabbed a tissue. &#8220;Excuse me.&#8221; She wiped her nose, tossed the tissue, then pulled her engagement ring all the way off and put it on the ring finger of her right hand. She put her hands back in front of her on the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, Katie,&#8221; Patrick said slowly, savoring the words. She flinched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. So, Patrick, did you find something better? Are congratulations in order?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations are indeed in order, Katie. I found something much better,&#8221; he said, leaning forward and resting his fingertips on hers.</p>
<p>She pulled away and tucked her hands into her lap. &#8220;That&#8217;s good, Patrick. I—we&#8217;ll miss you. You always were—dedicated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am. Thank you.&#8221; he said and rose. She sneezed again into her elbow and pumped a pool of sanitizer into her trembling hands. He left her office, hoping he left the soft scent of mold in his wake.</p>
<p>In June the walls in his house began to sweat. Beads of rain gathered indoors and slid down the windows. His moods changed wildly. He missed Danny, of all people, but he didn&#8217;t call.</p>
<p>He ordered the groceries delivered. He used simple little spells to find freelance coding and design gigs, the kind he could do from home without having to shake a hand or fake a smile. He stopped leaving the house altogether. The money came in steadily, and it gave him something to do other than masturbate or watch <em>The Exorcist</em> for the fifteenth time.</p>
<p>Spirits continued to reshape him inside. Patrick held faith that they wouldn&#8217;t let anything terrible happen to him. Not until it was finished, anyway.</p>
<p>His mother made her monthly call. She talked as though nothing unusual had happened, though she&#8217;d skipped May.</p>
<p>Then Rebecca called. He took the call, clearing his throat rather than saying hello.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you do that, you fucking bastard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice to hear from you, Becky. What charming insult is it this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what you did! Danny told me all about it. How dare you? I knew you were low, but I never—<em><u>never</u></em>—thought you&#8217;d use him to get back at me. You crushed him, Patrick!&#8221;</p>
<p>He ate a tablespoon of spoiled and refrozen peanut butter ice cream from its tub. &#8220;It took him this long to brag about it? I hardly think that giving your pet manchild his heart&#8217;s tenderest desire is so terrible, Becky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Becky screamed something unintelligible into his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was uncalled for. I&#8217;m hanging up now. Becky…please don&#8217;t call me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ended the call. She didn&#8217;t call back.</p>
<p>For the final few weeks, he took to bed and ate nothing but sweets. The Seattle weather outside had grown sunny and dry, but with shuttered window blinds the miasma in his house lingered. He took long baths, sometimes leaving the body-soiled water in the tub and returning to it later. As parts of his body shriveled and others bloated, Patrick wondered if he could actually detect the advancement of the mildew spreading along the shower tiles. It had also spread into his clothing. He didn&#8217;t need much clothing anymore.</p>
<p>The waiting was worst. He constantly felt as though he had to use the toilet, and each time he feared his guts would come tumbling out his ass. To pass the time, he researched names. “Caliban”—sufficiently poetic, Shakespearean, but also pulpy, a pale and bug-eyed comic book villain. Either way, Caliban was a pitiful thing. “Merlyn”—that was good, powerful, but still a bit tacky, too cartoonish to take seriously.</p>
<p>He decided on “Emrys.” That one was dignified. Regal, even.</p>
<p>On the equinox, he woke in the middle of the night to sheets sticky with filth. He&#8217;d shat the bed in his sleep. Sitting up, nausea overwhelmed him and he vomited, some of it getting into his nose. The spell reached its conclusion.</p>
<p>He struggled out of bed, down the short hall to his bathroom. He vomited again across the floor before he could get to the toilet. He slipped a little on it and nearly cracked his head open.</p>
<p>Patrick&#8217;s excitement bloomed. Each rack of nausea invigorated him. He twisted the taps of his bath and hoped it wouldn&#8217;t come before the tub filled. He had the presence of mind to place the trash bucket next to the tub so that he could puke there instead of into the water. <em>Why even bother?</em> he wondered, but he threw up into the container for the sake of it.</p>
<p>The cramps became rhythmic. The water&#8217;s level rose. He leaked feces and mucus into the tub. His bulbous abdomen writhed.</p>
<p>It came quicker than he&#8217;d feared. He&#8217;d had months upon months to imagine an excruciating rite that would last for twenty hours, tearing his rectum like paper. This, however, only took about ninety minutes. He heaved and huffed and applied lubricants and a topical anesthetic. The previous weeks&#8217; muscle training, steadily increasing the size of the objects with which he penetrated himself, was worth every drop of precious blood.</p>
<p>The squeeze and stretch of it vacillated between unbearable and ecstatic. Then it was done.</p>
<p>He lifted the thing from the septic water. It was fist-sized and without limbs like a huge fat tadpole. There was no discernable face, only an oblong, greenish black body with a slick tail. It appeared almost sculptural, sleek and undifferentiated, a polished mass.</p>
<p>Patrick&#8217;s short-lived exhaustion gave way to a new panic. The baby was dead. It didn&#8217;t move its little tail, didn&#8217;t quiver or wriggle. This was the cruelest gift. The demons had helped it grow to term inside of him, had shape-shifted his body ever so slowly to support this life, only to have it born lifeless.</p>
<p>His baby. His and Danny&#8217;s and the demons&#8217;, an infernal parentage necessary to bring forth a new marvel that would earn Patrick Soames’ name a place in Hell&#8217;s genealogy.</p>
<p>Now nothing. Just pain. He laughed at the absurdity of it. In what did demons traffic, if not suffering? Their traps shattered the faces daring to eat the bait.</p>
<p>He held the cambion to his chest. &#8220;Please live. Your name is Emrys. Emrys Daniel Soames.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held it up again, desperate for it to move. And then it did.</p>
<p>The tail flicked. And again. It struggled in his hands, then shot a brackish fluid out of an unseen hole at its anterior end. Patrick&#8217;s tears continued to flow, now drops of hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did it,&#8221; he said to the baby, to the invisible demons watching from mildewy shadows.</p>
<p>The baby breathed, its mass expanding and contracting gently and with a barely audible whistling. Patrick examined it, turning it over and around. A thought occurred to him, one that surprised him for not surfacing before.</p>
<p>He pulled the baby in close to his face, ready to kiss it. &#8220;Are you…the Antichrist?&#8221;</p>
<p>A single eye opened and blinked at him, startlingly human and aware. A seam opened, revealing gleaming, square little human teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Father,&#8221; came the child&#8217;s voice. &#8220;You are not so special.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**Friends, here&#8217;s a short essay that was previously published on the <a href="hugohouse.org" target="_blank">Richard Hugo House</a> website. It was a promotional item for my RHH class, Writing the Monster. I&#8217;m reposting here now that it&#8217;s unavailable elsewhere.**</p>
<p><span id="more-546"></span></p>
<h2><strong>The Monster From Beyond Our World (of Literary Merit)</strong></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve loved monsters since I was a small child. I had a vicious-looking plastic T-Rex as a bath toy instead of a rubber ducky. I quickly graduated to a preoccupation with vampires and werewolves. I thought dragons were real, albeit extinct, until I was quite old. I knew about Dracula before learning about Jesus (I was raised Jewish), and I dressed as a vampire for Halloween at least two years in a row, perhaps three, before deciding to be a mummy at age 9. My mother used to refer to me as &#8220;one of the Addams family children.&#8221; This phase never wore off.</p>
<p>For children (not to mention adults), monsters are important to play and learning. They allow for the exploration of power and desire, deeply seated Freudian Id stuff. Monsters get to do whatever they want. Who will stop them? But someone almost always stops them; in contemporary American childhood, all stories are expected to have happy endings, especially when the monsters turn out to be misunderstood and benevolent.</p>
<p>Monsters also present a great opportunity for imagination. They are unpredictable in many ways, not just behavior; they have abilities&#8211;powers&#8211;that we can only guess at until it&#8217;s too late. They change shape. They fly. They hypnotize, turn invisible, and walk through walls. This interplay between fear, power, and imagination is intoxicating at any age.</p>
<p>As I grew into adolescence and young adulthood, monsters continued to represent power and possibility, but with a new twist: they&#8217;re outsiders. The ultimate Other. No one in Western literature is as isolated and dejected as Frankenstein&#8217;s monster, except perhaps for Quasimodo or Dracula. <em>Young Werther</em> has nothing on Frankenstein&#8217;s monster, who is so miserably anonymous that he doesn&#8217;t even have a name. Call me melodramatic, but as an angsty, hormonal, and closeted queer teenager, these characters seemed like fitting proxies for my lot in life.</p>
<p>Because monsters are so dear to me (and many others), I&#8217;m offended outright when monster stories are labelled as &#8220;genre fiction,&#8221; which is a backhanded euphemism for &#8220;something other than real literature.&#8221; This is not only inherently prejudiced (the educated class taking it upon itself to define &#8220;real literature&#8221;), it&#8217;s just plain false. <em>Frankenstein</em> is, for all of its awkwardness, a goddamn masterpiece on the topic of hubris, social justice, and the question of humanity. Are the ghost stories <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> and <em>Beloved</em> considered &#8220;genre fiction?&#8221; Is <em>Beowulf </em>or Dante&#8217;s <em>Inferno</em>?</p>
<p>Stephen King&#8217;s <em>Carrie</em> is a classic gothic tale of religious fanaticism and community bullying. Anne Rice&#8217;s monster fiction is sumptuous, historically rich, and all too human. And the Martians and Morlocks of H. G. Wells are wildly subversive and clever piss-takes on British culture.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the only difference between realistic literature and literature that contains monsters? Simple. It&#8217;s not quality, intellect, or emotional depth. The difference is that supernatural and science fiction literature blast open the boundaries of realism and sprint gleefully into the uncharted territory of asking, &#8220;What if?&#8221;</p>
<p>This, dear reader, is more difficult to do than acknowledged. I want to help you learn how to write about the monsters, be they fantastical or all too human, without or within. Hopefully, you can help me too. Teaching, like all arts, works both ways.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Evan J. Peterson</p>
